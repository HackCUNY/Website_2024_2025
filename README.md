## Code Rules
- We are using React Vite.
- Everyone should only be making coding changes in their designated file only. In other words, your PR should only include changes in one single file. This means that your css and react code will be in one single file. Below is what we should follow to only make changes in the file you are working on.
    - Styled Components React: https://styled-components.com/
    - All your files already have the library installed/imported.
    - All you files includes a template code for a styled compenent. Please delete that code when you don't need it anymore.
    - This will help us write all our code in one single file (that we're working on), and will prevent merging conflicts.
- All imports are already in your files, so no need to update code in any other file (in your PR). If there is, please ping Leandro G. (r0m3c)
- All images from the Figma are included in the Client/src/assets folder. The naming convention should be related to the section you are working on. If we are missing an image, please let Leandro G. (r0m3c) know and he'll add the image.
- Please use all colors/designs as we have it on the Wire Diagram in Figma. All components on Figma also have their Hex color so the colors should be the same.
- Make sure to always "git pull origin main" to get updated code from repo before beginning to code
- If you haven't already, please let me know what your GitHub username is via discord. 
- Please try to write neat and organized code to make it easier for code reviews.
- If you are unable to finish your section by the Huly deadline please let Leandro G. (r0m3c) know via discord.
- If you have any library that you think we should add, please let Leandro G. know in advance and he'll install it.
- For any questions/clarification ping Leandro (leocool99) on discord

## Branches
- Naming: Name the branch starting by section you are working on followed by what that branch does
    - Ex: our-team-draft
    - Ex: about-small-edit

## Pull Request
- PR Message: Make sure your message depicts what your branch does/what you worked on.
- PR Review: Make sure to make Leandro G. (r0m3c) reviewer for your PR. If he doesn't answer within an hour, ping him on discord (leocool99)
- Please write neat code to make reviews go much faster.
